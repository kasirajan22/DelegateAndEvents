# DelegateAndEvents
 
#### Delegates

A delegate in C# is like a type-safe function pointer. It encapsulates a method reference and can be passed around like any other object.

#### Events
Events in C# are built on delegates and are used to provide notifications. Events are a way for a class to provide notifications to clients of that class when something of interest occurs.

#### How They are Helpful in OOP:

* Encapsulation: Delegates encapsulate method calls, allowing methods to be treated as objects, passed as parameters, and invoked dynamically.
*  Event Handling: Events allow a class to notify other classes or components when something interesting happens. This decouples the sender from the receiver, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.
*  Callbacks: Delegates facilitate callback methods, enabling methods to be passed and called back when certain conditions are met.
*  Multicasting: Delegates support multicasting, meaning a single delegate instance can reference multiple methods.
*  Asynchronous Programming: Delegates can be used for asynchronous method calls, enhancing application performance and responsiveness.
